TRANSLATION NOTES
================================================================================

Language: Assamese → English

Key themes:
- Nostalgia and longing for a father's love
- Loss, memory, and the passage of time
- Emotional yearning and the uncertainty of reconnection
- Poetic language using metaphors of fragrance and touch

Cultural context:
- The song appears to be deeply personal, likely addressing loss of a parent
- References to "father's eyes" suggest childhood memories
- Themes of emotional vulnerability and questioning
- Rich sensory imagery (fragrance, touch, visual memories)

Singable form notes:
- The English translation maintains the emotional weight of the original
- Syllable counts vary but preserve the lyrical flow
- Primary emotional beats align between Assamese and English
- Suitable for voice cloning and adaptation

NEXT STEPS: VOICE CLONING WITH RVC
================================================================================

Files prepared for training:
1. Original audio: audio/pamne-moi-ghurai.wav (full mix)
2. Isolated vocals: separated/vocals.wav (isolated vocal track)
3. Training data: training_data/vocals_full.wav (ready for RVC model training)

RVC Model Training Process:
1. Set up RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion)
2. Upload the training vocal file (training_data/vocals_full.wav)
3. Train model for 300-500 epochs (or until satisfactory quality)
4. Generate English singing voice using trained model
5. Mix with instrumental track for final output

Recommended RVC Implementation:
- GitHub: https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio
- Or: https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI
