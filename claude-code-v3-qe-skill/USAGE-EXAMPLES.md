## Example 1: Todo App (Beginner)

**Use case:** Learning the skill with a simple CRUD application.

```markdown
# Build with Quality - Claude Flow V3 Swarm

## Skill Activation
build-with-quality v1.0.0 (111+ agents, hierarchical-mesh)
Config: skill.yaml

## Project Context
- **Name:** SimpleTodo
- **Type:** web-app
- **Stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite + localStorage
- **Description:** A minimalist todo application for learning TDD

## Task
Build a todo app with add, complete, and delete functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add new todos with text input
- [ ] Mark todos as complete (strikethrough)
- [ ] Delete todos
- [ ] Persist to localStorage
- [ ] Filter by: All, Active, Completed

## Methodology
- **DDD:** Todo aggregate (id, text, completed, createdAt)
- **ADR:** Document state management choice (useState vs useReducer)
- **TDD:** Test each CRUD operation before implementing

## Quality Gates (Relaxed for Learning)
- Coverage: 70% minimum
- Security: Basic XSS prevention
- Accessibility: WCAG A (keyboard navigation)

## Execute
1. Create Todo component with TDD
2. Implement CRUD operations
3. Add localStorage persistence
4. Build filter functionality
5. Verify all tests pass

Deliver working todo app with tests.
```

## Example 2: REST API (Intermediate)

**Use case:** Building a production-ready API with authentication.

```markdown
# Build with Quality - Claude Flow V3 Swarm

## Skill Activation
build-with-quality v1.0.0 (111+ agents, hierarchical-mesh)
Config: skill.yaml

## Project Context
- **Name:** TaskAPI
- **Type:** api
- **Stack:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- **Description:** RESTful API for task management with JWT authentication

## Task

- [ ] CRUD for projects (owned by users)
- [ ] CRUD for tasks (belong to projects)
- [ ] Role-based access (admin, member)
- [ ] Rate limiting (100 req/min)
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation

## Methodology
- **DDD:**
  - Bounded Contexts: Identity, ProjectManagement
  - Aggregates: User, Project, Task
  - Domain Events: UserRegistered, TaskCompleted
- **ADR:**
  - ADR-001: JWT vs Session authentication
  - ADR-002: Prisma vs TypeORM
- **TDD:** Test each endpoint before implementation

## Quality Gates
- Coverage: 85% overall, 95% auth flows
- Security: 0 critical (OWASP top 10)
- Contracts: OpenAPI schema validation

## Swarm Emphasis
```yaml
agents:
  priority:
    - security-architect (auth design)
    - integration-test-generator (API tests)
    - contract-validator (OpenAPI)
  security_focus:
    - SQL injection
    - JWT vulnerabilities
    - Rate limiting bypass
```

## Execute
Phase 1: Design auth system with security-architect
Phase 2: TDD for User aggregate and auth endpoints

## Quality Gates (Production Critical)
- Coverage: 90% overall, 100% payment flows
- Security: 0 any severity, PCI-DSS compliance
- Accessibility: WCAG AA, keyboard checkout
- Chaos: 90% graceful degradation (Stripe outage)

## Swarm Configuration
```yaml

  security: 2 concurrent (PCI focus)
max_agents: 100
topology: hierarchical-mesh
```

## Execute
Phase 1: DDD modeling with architect
  - Define all bounded contexts
  - Create context map
  - Document ADRs
Phase 2: Catalog domain (TDD)
