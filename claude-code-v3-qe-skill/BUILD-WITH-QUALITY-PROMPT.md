# Build with Quality - Consolidated Skill Prompt

## Overview

This is a **self-contained, copy-paste prompt** that invokes the full Claude Flow V3 + Agentic QE skill for building software with integrated quality engineering. Use this prompt when starting any new project or feature.

> **🚨 EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:** Claude Code MUST use **Claude Flow** to orchestrate the swarm. Use MCP tools (`mcp__claude-flow__*`) if available, otherwise use **CLI commands** (`npx claude-flow@alpha ...`) as fallback. See [CLAUDE FLOW SWARM ORCHESTRATION](#claude-flow-swarm-orchestration) section for both approaches.

## Configuration Reference

This prompt is derived from the skill configuration at:
- **Skill Config:** [`config/skill.yaml`](./config/skill.yaml)
- **Usage Examples:** [`USAGE-EXAMPLES.md`](./USAGE-EXAMPLES.md)

All thresholds, agent definitions, methodology settings, and quality gates are defined in `skill.yaml`. This prompt summarizes them for human-readable activation.

| Prompt Says | skill.yaml Source |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "85% coverage" | `quality_gates.coverage.minimum: 85` |
| "TDD red-green-refactor" | `methodologies.tdd.phases` |
| "111+ agents" | `swarm.domains[*].agents` |
| "SONA balanced mode" | `learning.sona.mode: balanced` |
| "WCAG AA" | `quality_gates.accessibility.level: AA` |

```markdown
# Build with Quality - Claude Flow V3 Swarm Architecture

## SKILL ACTIVATION

I am invoking the **Build with Quality** skill (v1.0.0) which combines:
- **Claude Flow V3**: 60+ development agents
- **Agentic QE**: 51 quality engineering agents
- **Shared Coordination**: 3 coordination agents
- **Total**: 111+ specialized agents

## PREREQUISITES

Before proceeding, ensure **BOTH** orchestration tools are initialized:

### 1. Claude Flow V3 (Development & Coordination Agents)
```bash
# Check if installed
npx claude-flow --version

# If not installed, initialize:
npx claude-flow@alpha init

# Or full installation with MCP:
curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ruvnet/claude-flow@main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --full
```

### 2. Agentic QE (Quality Engineering Agents)
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g agentic-qe

# Initialize in your project
aqe init --auto

# Add as MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add aqe -- aqe-mcp

# Verify connection
claude mcp list  # Should show 'aqe' server
```

### 3. Verify Both Tools
```bash
npx claude-flow --version   # Should show version
aqe --version               # Should show version
claude mcp list             # Should show 'aqe' in list
```

> ⚠️ **Without both tools**: The skill falls back to single-agent execution with manual quality checks. You lose swarm coordination, AI test generation, mutation testing, defect prediction, and pattern learning.

  - Value Objects (immutable)
  - Domain Events (state transitions)
  - Repositories (persistence abstraction)
```

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

```

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
```yaml
cycle:
  red: Write failing test first
  green: Minimum code to pass
  refactor: Clean up, maintain green

naming: "should_[expected]_when_[condition]"
commit_policy: After each green phase
```

## CLAUDE FLOW SWARM ORCHESTRATION

**CRITICAL: Claude Code MUST use Claude Flow to orchestrate the swarm.**

Claude Flow can be used in two ways:
1. **MCP Tools** (preferred) - If `mcp__claude-flow__*` tools are available
2. **CLI Commands** (fallback) - If MCP is not configured, use `npx claude-flow@alpha` commands

---

### Option A: MCP Tools (When Available)

Use these MCP tools in ONE parallel batch:

```
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init {
  topology: "hierarchical-mesh",
  maxAgents: 13,
  strategy: "parallel"
}

mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coordinator", name: "unified-coordinator" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "architect", name: "system-architect" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder", name: "primary-developer" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder", name: "secondary-developer" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "reviewer", name: "code-reviewer" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "tester", name: "test-strategist" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "tester", name: "unit-test-generator" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "tester", name: "e2e-test-generator" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "analyst", name: "coverage-analyzer" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "security", name: "security-scanner" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "researcher", name: "tech-researcher" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coordinator", name: "quality-coordinator" }
```

Then orchestrate and monitor:
```
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate { task: "[PROJECT]", strategy: "parallel" }
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage { action: "store", key: "project/init", value: {...} }
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_status { verbose: true }
```

---

### Option B: CLI Commands (Fallback When MCP Not Available)

**If `mcp__claude-flow__*` tools are NOT available, use CLI commands instead:**

#### Step 1: Initialize Swarm
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm init --topology hierarchical-mesh --max-agents 13 --strategy parallel
```

#### Step 2: Spawn Agents (run in parallel via Bash)
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type coordinator --name unified-coordinator &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type architect --name system-architect &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type coder --name primary-developer &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type coder --name secondary-developer &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type reviewer --name code-reviewer &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type tester --name test-strategist &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type tester --name unit-test-generator &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type tester --name e2e-test-generator &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type analyst --name coverage-analyzer &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type security --name security-scanner &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type researcher --name tech-researcher &
npx claude-flow@alpha agent spawn --type coordinator --name quality-coordinator &
wait
```

#### Step 3: Orchestrate Tasks
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha task orchestrate --task "[PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]" --strategy parallel
```

#### Step 4: Store Memory
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store --key "project/phase/decisions" --value '{"decision": "value"}'
```

#### Step 5: Monitor Progress
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm status --verbose
npx claude-flow@alpha agent list
npx claude-flow@alpha agent metrics
```

---

### Agent Coordination Protocol (Required for ALL Agents)

Each spawned Task agent MUST run these CLI hooks for coordination:

**Before starting work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "[task description]" --auto-spawn-agents false
```

**After each file operation:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[filepath]" --memory-key "agent/[step]"
```

**To share decisions with other agents:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notification --message "[what was decided/done]" --telemetry true
```

**After completing work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task]" --analyze-performance true
```

---

### Detection Logic

Claude Code should check for MCP availability at the start:

```
IF mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init is available:
    USE MCP Tools (Option A)
ELSE:
    USE CLI Commands (Option B)
```

Both approaches provide the same swarm coordination - MCP is just more integrated.

## ⚠️ DEGRADED MODE (Tools Not Installed)

If the prerequisite tools are not installed, the skill operates in degraded mode:

### Capability Matrix by Installation State

| Capability | Full (Both Tools) | Claude Flow Only | Agentic QE Only | Neither (Single Agent) |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Swarm orchestration** | ✓ 100 agents | ✓ 60 agents | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Development agents** | ✓ architect, coder, reviewer | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ Manual |
| **AI test generation** | ✓ All types | ❌ Basic | ✓ | ❌ Manual |
| **Coverage analysis** | ✓ HNSW O(log n) | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ `npm test --coverage` |
| **Mutation testing** | ✓ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ Not available |
| **Defect prediction** | ✓ F1 > 0.8 | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ Not available |
| **Chaos engineering** | ✓ | ❌ | ✓ | ❌ Not available |
| **Security scanning** | ✓ SAST + DAST | ✓ SAST | ❌ | ❌ Manual |
| **SONA learning** | ✓ Full | ✓ Partial | ✓ Partial | ❌ None |
| **ReasoningBank** | ✓ Full | ✓ Partial | ✓ Partial | ❌ None |
| **Quality gates** | ✓ Automated | ✓ Partial | ✓ Partial | ❌ Manual |

### Fallback Behavior

**Without Claude Flow V3:**
- No swarm coordination (single-threaded execution)
- No architect/coder/reviewer agent separation
- No browser-agent visual validation
- Security scanning limited to manual SAST

**Without Agentic QE:**
- No AI-powered test generation
- No mutation testing (critical for test quality)
- No defect prediction model
- No chaos/resilience testing
- Coverage analysis via basic `npm test -- --coverage`
- No flaky test detection

**Without Both (Current Default):**
- Claude (single agent) follows TDD methodology manually
- Tests written by Claude without specialized generators
- Coverage checked via CLI tools
- No pattern learning or persistence
- Quality gates checked manually via build/test commands
- ~40% slower than full swarm execution

### Recommended Minimum

For meaningful skill benefits, install at least **one** tool:

```bash
# Option A: Development focus (faster coding, parallel work)
npx claude-flow@alpha init

# Option B: Quality focus (better tests, mutation, prediction)
npm install -g agentic-qe && aqe init --auto && claude mcp add aqe -- aqe-mcp

# Option C: Full capability (recommended)
# Install both as per PREREQUISITES section
```
