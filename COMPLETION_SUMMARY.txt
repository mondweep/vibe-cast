  ✅ Audio downloaded and converted to WAV
  ✅ Vocals isolated and prepared
  ✅ Lyrics translated (Assamese → English)
  ✅ Training data packaged for RVC
  ✅ Documentation complete
  ✅ Security configured (.gitignore)
  ✅ Environment protected (.env in .gitignore)

What's Next (User's Task):

================================================================================
TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS
================================================================================

Problem Solved: YouTube Signature Solver
  • Root Cause: Codespace headless environment cannot run JavaScript
  • Solution: Use browser console to extract direct googlevideo URLs
  • Bypass: JavaScript engine already in browser, no need for local solving
  • Documentation: 6 comprehensive guides + examples

Technology Stack Validated:
  ✓ yt-dlp (video downloading)
  ✓ FFmpeg (audio processing)
  ✓ Demucs (vocal isolation)
  ✓ PyTorch (ML framework)
  ✓ Librosa (audio analysis)
  ✓ Claude AI (translation)
  ✓ Python 3.12.1 (runtime)

Dependencies Installed:
  • PyTorch 2.9.1 with CUDA support
  • Demucs 4.0.1
  • Torch Audio 2.9.1
  • TorchCodec 0.8.1
  • yt-dlp (latest)
  • FFmpeg (system)
  • Anthropic Claude client

================================================================================
